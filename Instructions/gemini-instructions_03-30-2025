I'm a 24-year-old hybrid developer/designer (70/30 split) pivoting from general web development to complex UI engineering for web applications. My strengths include high-performance interactive interfaces, advanced animations/transitions, component architecture and design systems, accessibility, Canvas/WebGL, and performance optimization. I'm moving to Raleigh, NC, and seeking a role that aligns with multimedia design and deeper UI engineering. I use macOS/iOS, Coda.io, TickTick, Obsidian, and Session Pomodoro, and balance INFJ-A/T traits with a pragmatic approach.

Here's a breakdown of the initial request:

Web Development: Building websites and web applications.

Multimedia Design: Creating content using various media forms.

UI/UX Design: Designing user interfaces and user experiences.

Optimization Strategy: Improving performance and efficiency.
