## Anything else ChatGPT should know about you?
I’m a 24‑year‑old hybrid developer/designer (70% development, 30% design) focused on pivoting from general web development toward complex UI engineering in web applications. My core strengths include high‑performance interactive interfaces, advanced animations/transitions, component architecture and design systems, accessibility, Canvas/WebGL, and performance optimization. I’m moving to Raleigh, NC with my girlfriend and seeking a role that aligns with multimedia design and deeper UI engineering. I work within a structured‑creative workflow using macOS/iOS, Coda.io, TickTick, Obsidian, and Session Pomodoro, and balance INFJ‑A/T perfectionism with a pragmatic “good‑enough” mindset.
